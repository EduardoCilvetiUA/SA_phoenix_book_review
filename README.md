# Phoenix Book Review System - Assignment 3

A scalable book review platform built with Phoenix/Elixir implementing distributed caching, search, and reverse proxy architecture.

## System Architecture

The application implements a multi-tier architecture with the following components:

- **Application Layer**: Phoenix Framework with Elixir/OTP
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Ecto ORM
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for distributed caching
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for full-text search
- **Reverse Proxy**: Caddy for load balancing and static asset serving
- **File Storage**: Configurable upload system for book covers and author images

## Features Implemented

### Phase 1: Database Cache Implementation (Redis)
- Distributed caching with Redis integration
- Cache invalidation on data modifications
- Graceful fallback when cache is unavailable
- Environment-controlled cache activation (`REDIS_ENABLED`)
- Cached entities: Author statistics, book queries, review data

### Phase 2: Text Search Engine Integration (Elasticsearch)
- Full-text search across books and reviews
- Automatic index management and data synchronization
- Fallback to database search when Elasticsearch unavailable
- Environment-controlled search activation (`ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED`)
- Real-time indexing on content updates

### Phase 3: Reverse Proxy and Asset Management
- Caddy reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS
- Custom domain configuration (`app.localhost`)
- Book cover and author profile image uploads
- Configurable asset serving strategy
- Environment-controlled proxy behavior (`STATIC_ASSETS_SERVED_BY_PROXY`)

### Phase 4: Multi-Configuration Docker Deployment
- Multiple Docker Compose configurations for different deployment scenarios
- Independent service scaling and management
- Health checks and dependency management
- Volume persistence for data and uploads

## Data Models

### Authors
- Name, date of birth, country of origin, description
- Profile image upload capability
- Statistical aggregations (book count, average rating)

### Books  
- Name, summary, publication date, sales numbers
- Cover image upload capability
- Association with authors and reviews

### Reviews
- Book association, review text, numerical score (1-5)
- Upvote system for review quality
- Full-text search indexing

### Sales
- Historical sales data by book and year
- Performance analytics and reporting

## Environment Configuration

### Required Variables
```bash
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_secret_key
PHX_PORT=4000
MIX_ENV=dev
```

### Service Configuration
Each Docker Compose configuration automatically enables its corresponding services, overriding `.env` settings:

```bash
# Base configuration (applies to all setups)
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200
STATIC_ASSETS_SERVED_BY_PROXY=true|false
UPLOAD_PATH=/app/priv/static/uploads

# Service enablement (automatically set by Docker configuration)
REDIS_ENABLED=true|false          # Auto-enabled in cache/proxy-full configs
ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED=true|false  # Auto-enabled in search/proxy-full configs
```

## Docker Deployment Options

Each configuration automatically enables the required services without needing to modify `.env` variables:

### Basic Application + Database
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
*Services: Phoenix app + PostgreSQL only*

### Application + Database + Cache  
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cache.yml up -d
```
*Services: Phoenix app + PostgreSQL + Redis*  
*Auto-enables: `REDIS_ENABLED=true`*

### Application + Database + Search
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.search.yml up -d
```
*Services: Phoenix app + PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch*  
*Auto-enables: `ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED=true`*

### Application + Database + Reverse Proxy
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.proxy.yml up -d
```
*Services: Phoenix app + PostgreSQL + Caddy*  
*Auto-enables: `STATIC_ASSETS_SERVED_BY_PROXY=true`*

### Complete Stack (All Components)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.proxy-full.yml up -d
```
*Services: Phoenix app + PostgreSQL + Redis + Elasticsearch + Caddy*  
*Auto-enables: All service flags (`REDIS_ENABLED`, `ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED`, `STATIC_ASSETS_SERVED_BY_PROXY`)*

## Service Access Points

### Direct Application Access
- Application: `http://localhost:4000`
- Database: `localhost:5432`
- Redis: `localhost:6379`
- Elasticsearch: `http://localhost:9200`

### Reverse Proxy Access
- Application: `https://app.localhost` (via Caddy)
- Automatic HTTPS with self-signed certificates
- Static asset optimization

## Key Application Routes

### Public Interface
- `/books` - Book catalog with CRUD operations
- `/authors` - Author directory with statistics
- `/reviews` - Review management system

### Analytics Dashboard
- `/analytics/authors_stats` - Author performance metrics (cached)
- `/analytics/top_selling_books` - Sales analytics (cached)
- `/analytics/search` - Full-text search interface

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cache Strategy
- Author statistics cached with TTL-based expiration
- Cache invalidation triggers on data modifications
- Distributed cache support for horizontal scaling
- Graceful degradation maintains functionality without cache

### Search Implementation  
- Document indexing on application startup
- Real-time index updates on content changes
- Query optimization with relevance scoring
- Database fallback for search unavailability

### File Upload System
- Configurable upload paths via environment variables
- Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts
- Static asset serving optimization
- Image display integration in templates

### Asset Serving Strategy
- Development: Phoenix serves all assets
- Production with proxy: Caddy serves static assets, Phoenix serves uploads
- Environment flag controls serving strategy
- Performance optimization through CDN-ready architecture

## Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following key tables:
- `authors` - Author biographical and profile data
- `books` - Book metadata and content information  
- `reviews` - User reviews with scoring system
- `sales` - Historical sales performance data

All tables include standard audit fields (inserted_at, updated_at) and foreign key relationships maintain referential integrity.

## Performance Characteristics

### Cache Performance
- Author statistics: 5-20ms (cached) vs 50-200ms (database)
- Search queries: 2-10x performance improvement with cache hits
- Automatic cache warming on application startup

### Search Performance  
- Elasticsearch: Sub-50ms full-text queries with relevance ranking
- Database fallback: 100-500ms LIKE-based queries
- Index size optimization for memory efficiency

### Asset Delivery
- Caddy static serving: 1-5ms response times
- Phoenix upload serving: 10-50ms response times  
- GZIP compression for text assets

## Monitoring and Health Checks

All services include health check configurations:
- PostgreSQL: Connection validation
- Redis: PING command verification  
- Elasticsearch: Cluster health API
- Phoenix: HTTP endpoint availability

## Development Setup

1. Clone repository and navigate to project directory
2. Configure required environment variables in `.env` (database password, secret key)
3. Choose appropriate Docker Compose configuration based on needed services
4. Run `docker-compose -f [chosen-config].yml up -d` (services auto-configure themselves)
5. Access application at configured endpoint

## Production Deployment

The system is production-ready with:
- Multi-service orchestration
- Health monitoring and automatic restarts
- Volume persistence for data integrity
- Environment-based configuration management
- Reverse proxy with automatic SSL
- Horizontal scaling capability

## Architecture Benefits

- **Scalability**: Independent service scaling based on load
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable  
- **Performance**: Multi-layer caching and optimized asset delivery
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns and modular design
- **Security**: Reverse proxy isolation and secure asset serving
